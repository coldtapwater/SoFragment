# soren: a foundational model that’s trying its best :>

soren is not your average ai model—it’s a foundational model designed to approach problems like a human would. it’s not here to be perfect at everything (who is?), but instead to break down problems, use the tools and resources it has, and save what it learns along the way. think of it as a work-in-progress that’s always ready to roll up its sleeves and give it a go.

## what is soren? 🤔

soren is built to act, not overthink. it’s designed to:

• **analyze** your requests like a human would, figuring out how to get stuff done.
 
• use the **resources** and tools available to it (hello, solta framework).
 
• **save** and **recall** relevant information when needed.

but let’s be real—soren isn’t here to solve world hunger or write your thesis. it’s meant to tackle everyday tasks in a practical, no-fuss way. and the best part? it’s trainable even after initial training, so you can refine it, tweak it, and make it yours as it grows.

## what can soren do? ✅

• **act** on your requests: whether it’s organizing files, managing tasks, or using tools, soren is here to do things.
 
• **approach** problems like a human: instead of brute-forcing its way through, it breaks down problems and uses what it knows (and learns).
 
• **adapt and learn**: soren can save what it learns, making it more capable the more you use it.

## what can’t soren do? ❌

• complex thinking: soren isn’t a philosopher. tasks requiring deep knowledge bases or intricate problem-solving aren’t its thing (yet).
 
• be perfect: let’s face it, nobody’s perfect—not even soren. it’s a work-in-progress designed to get better with time.

# soren + the sofragment solta framework 🚀

when paired with solta, soren becomes part of a modular, tool-driven ecosystem. here’s how they work together:

• **tools & resources**: solta’s tools extend soren’s capabilities, enabling it to handle specific tasks (think search, memory, calculations, etc.).
 
• **agent-based architecture**: within solta, soren can act as an agent, collaborating with others to achieve goals.
 
• **trainability**: solta provides the perfect environment for soren to keep learning and improving, even after initial deployment.
 

## why soren?

because not every model needs to be a know-it-all. sometimes, it’s enough to have a model that’s curious, adaptable, and just gets things done. if you’re looking for a model that’s practical, human-like in its approach, and ready to grow with you, soren’s your guy.

soren doesn’t dream, but if it did, it’d probably dream about solving problems faster than me. one day, maybe. >:>
